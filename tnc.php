							<li>If the business representative cancels the order after the interview, or after talking to our content coordinator about their business for more than 10 minutes, a fixed ₹1000 cancellation charge will be applicable. </li>
							<li>Once the order gets confirmed, the confirmation will be placed over a text/call/email with the client’s signature on the form. We will be sending a soft copy to the client regarding the confirmation and in return the client will be expected to send a scanned and signed form via mail.</li>
							<li>A maximum of 5 design related changes can be made while the magazine is being drafted. This being if there is a genuine mistake from the designer’s end. Too many changes would confuse the designer and result in an unsatisfied outcome.</li>
							<li>If the client has any design reference in their mind, they are supposed to share it prior to the writing and designing process. We want the results to be just as you expect, hence we prefer the client telling us their design preferences beforehand.</li>
							<li>Once the design is finalized, the image can be replaced more than 5 times and the text can be changed minimum 3 times as per the client’s demand. Too many changes will hinder the design. </li>
							<li>Changes will be done in a single sitting, hence the design and content shall be finalized before starting the design. Even if the client has any changes after starting the design, it is expected to get all the changes made in a single sitting and not one by one.</li>
